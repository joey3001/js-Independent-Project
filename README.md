# Javascript Form Project

#### This application uses forms in Javascript to gather user input and return different results based upon that input. 

#### By Joseph Nero 

### Description

This application will take user input through a form and generate a set of responses based on that input. In particular, this form will tell you which programming language you should learn based on the way you answer some questions. This is achieved through branching If-statements in Javascript.
